        <h3>Beyond Single-Instruction Issue</h3>
        <p>Superscalar processors can fetch, decode, and execute multiple instructions in parallel, significantly improving throughput.</p>
        
        <h4>Superscalar Concept</h4>
        <p>While pipelining improves processor throughput by overlapping instruction execution, superscalar architectures take parallelism further:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple instructions are issued in the same cycle</li>
          <li>Multiple execution units operate in parallel</li>
          <li>Multiple results can complete in the same cycle</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)</h4>
        <p>The performance of superscalar processors depends on the amount of instruction-level parallelism available in the code:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ILP</strong>: The potential overlap among instructions</li>
          <li><strong>Typical ILP</strong>: 2-5 instructions in general-purpose code</li>
          <li><strong>Limiting factors</strong>: Data dependencies, control dependencies, resource constraints</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Superscalar Pipeline Design</h4>
        <p>A superscalar pipeline must solve several challenges:</p>

        <h4>Degree of Superscalarity</h4>
        <p>The width of a superscalar processor refers to the maximum number of instructions it can issue per cycle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2-way superscalar</strong>: Can issue up to 2 instructions per cycle</li>
          <li><strong>4-way superscalar</strong>: Can issue up to 4 instructions per cycle</li>
          <li><strong>8-way superscalar</strong>: Can issue up to 8 instructions per cycle</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Modern high-performance processors are typically 4-way to 8-way superscalar, though the actual number of instructions issued each cycle is often lower due to dependency and resource constraints.</p>

      title: "Out-of-Order Execution",
      content: `
        <h3>Dynamic Instruction Scheduling</h3>
        <p>Out-of-order execution allows processors to execute instructions in an order different from program order to maximize utilization of execution units and hide latency.</p>
        
        <h4>Limitations of In-Order Execution</h4>
        <p>In an in-order pipeline, if an instruction stalls (e.g., due to a cache miss), all subsequent instructions also stall, even if they could execute independently:</p>
        
        <pre style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
lw   x1, 0(x2)      # Load might miss in cache
add  x3, x4, x5     # Independent of the load, could proceed
sub x6, x1, x7      # Depends on the load result, must wait
or   x8, x9, x10    # Independent of all previous, could proceed</pre>
        
        <p>With in-order execution, all instructions after the load would stall, wasting potential execution opportunities.</p>
        
        <h4>Out-of-Order Concept</h4>
        <p>Out-of-order execution decouples instruction fetch/decode from execution:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Instructions are fetched and decoded in program order</li>
          <li>They are dispatched to a buffer (reservation stations or instruction window)</li>
          <li>Instructions execute when their operands are ready, potentially out of order</li>
          <li>Results are reordered to maintain program semantics</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

          <p><em>Simplified view of out-of-order execution pipeline</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Tomasulo's Algorithm</h4>
        <p>A foundational approach to out-of-order execution was developed by Robert Tomasulo at IBM in the 1960s:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses reservation stations to queue operations waiting for operands</li>
          <li>Implements register renaming to eliminate WAR and WAW hazards</li>
          <li>Uses a common data bus (CDB) for broadcasting results</li>
          <li>Implements tag-based operand tracking</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Instruction Lifecycle in Out-of-Order Processors</h4>
        <p>An instruction goes through several stages in an out-of-order pipeline:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Fetch/Decode</strong>: Instructions are fetched and decoded in program order</li>
          <li><strong>Rename</strong>: Architectural registers are mapped to physical registers to eliminate false dependencies</li>
          <li><strong>Dispatch</strong>: Instructions are sent to reservation stations</li>
          <li><strong>Issue</strong>: When operands are ready, instructions are sent to execution units</li>
          <li><strong>Execute</strong>: The operation is performed</li>
          <li><strong>Complete</strong>: Results are calculated and made available to dependent instructions</li>
          <li><strong>Retire/Commit</strong>: Results are committed to architectural state in program order</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Reorder Buffer (ROB)</h4>
        <p>The reorder buffer enables in-order commitment of out-of-order executed instructions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tracks all in-flight instructions in program order</li>
          <li>Maintains the status of each instruction's execution</li>
          <li>Ensures instructions modify architectural state in program order</li>
          <li>Facilitates precise exception handling and speculation recovery</li>
        </ul>

          <p><em>Reorder buffer structure and operation</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Performance Benefits</h4>
        <p>Out-of-order execution provides several key advantages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tolerates memory latency by executing independent instructions during cache misses</li>
          <li>Improves utilization of functional units</li>
          <li>Extracts more instruction-level parallelism</li>
          <li>Adapts dynamically to runtime conditions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Modern out-of-order processors can sustain much higher instruction throughput than in-order designs, especially in code with variable latencies and mixed dependencies.</p>

      content: `
        <h3>Eliminating False Dependencies</h3>
        <p>Register renaming is a technique used to eliminate name dependencies (WAR and WAW hazards) that would otherwise limit instruction-level parallelism.</p>
        
        <h4>Register Dependency Types</h4>
        <p>Recall the three types of register dependencies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>RAW (Read-After-Write)</strong>: True dependency, cannot be eliminated</li>
          <li><strong>WAR (Write-After-Read)</strong>: Anti-dependency, can be eliminated with renaming</li>
          <li><strong>WAW (Write-After-Write)</strong>: Output dependency, can be eliminated with renaming</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Register Renaming Concept</h4>
        <p>Register renaming separates architectural registers (visible to the programmer) from physical registers (actual storage locations in hardware):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The processor maintains many more physical registers than architectural registers</li>
          <li>Each write to an architectural register is mapped to a new physical register</li>
          <li>Subsequent reads access the most recent mapping</li>
          <li>Old mappings are freed when no longer needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <pre style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
# Original code with WAR hazard
add x1, x2, x3      # x1 <- x2 + x3
sub x4, x1, x5      # x4 <- x1 - x5
mul x1, x6, x7      # x1 <- x6 * x7 (WAR hazard with sub)
xor x8, x1, x9      # x8 <- x1 XOR x9

# After register renaming
add p1, p2, p3      # p1 corresponds to x1
sub p4, p1, p5      # p4 corresponds to x4, reads from p1
mul p6, p7, p8      # p6 corresponds to x1 (new mapping)
xor p9, p6, p10     # p9 corresponds to x8, reads from p6

# Note: No WAR hazard between sub and mul since they use different physical registers</pre>
        
        <h4>Renaming Mechanisms</h4>
        <p>Processors implement register renaming using one of two primary approaches:</p>

          <p><em>Register renaming with a register alias table</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Register Renaming Process</h4>
        <p>The renaming process typically involves these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Rename Destination Registers</strong>: Allocate a new physical register for each instruction result</li>
          <li><strong>Map Source Registers</strong>: Find the current physical register mapping for each source operand</li>
          <li><strong>Update Mapping Table</strong>: Update the architectural-to-physical register mapping</li>
          <li><strong>Free Old Registers</strong>: Reclaim physical registers when their values are no longer needed</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Benefits of Register Renaming</h4>
        <p>Register renaming provides several important benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminates WAR and WAW hazards, enabling more out-of-order execution</li>
          <li>Increases the effective register count, reducing register pressure</li>
          <li>Simplifies the implementation of speculative execution</li>
          <li>Enables more aggressive compiler optimizations by making register reuse less problematic</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In modern processors, register renaming is essential for extracting high levels of instruction-level parallelism.</p>

        <h3>Precise Exceptions in Out-of-Order Processors</h3>
        <p>Handling exceptions correctly becomes more complex in processors with out-of-order execution and speculation.</p>
        
        <h4>Exception Handling Challenges</h4>
        <p>In a simple in-order pipeline, exception handling is relatively straightforward. However, in advanced pipelines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple instructions execute simultaneously</li>
          <li>Instructions may complete out of order</li>
          <li>Multiple exceptions might occur in the same cycle</li>
          <li>Some instructions might be speculative</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Precise vs. Imprecise Exceptions</h4>
        <p>A precise exception means the processor state is exactly as if the program executed sequentially up to the faulting instruction:</p>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
          <tr style="background-color:#f0f0f0">

            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Instructions before the faulting instruction have completed</li>
                <li>Instructions after the faulting instruction have not affected processor state</li>
                <li>The program counter points to the faulting instruction</li>
                <li>Execution can resume after exception handling</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Imprecise Exception</strong></td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Processor state does not reflect sequential execution</li>
                <li>Instructions after the fault may have partially executed</li>
                <li>Multiple exceptions might be reported together</li>
                <li>Difficult to resume execution reliably</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>Modern general-purpose processors almost always implement precise exceptions as they simplify programming, debugging, and operating system design.</p>
        
        <h4>Reorder Buffer for Exception Handling</h4>
        <p>The reorder buffer (ROB) is crucial for implementing precise exceptions in out-of-order processors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instructions enter the ROB in program order</li>
          <li>Exception conditions are recorded but not handled immediately</li>
          <li>Instructions retire from the ROB in program order</li>
          <li>When a retiring instruction has an exception, the processor:
            <ol>
              <li>Flushes all subsequent instructions from the pipeline</li>
              <li>Ensures all prior instructions have completed</li>
              <li>Saves the precise processor state</li>
              <li>Transfers control to the exception handler</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

            <td>Asynchronous (External)</td>

            <td>May be imprecise, often result in system reset</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h4>Speculative Execution and Exceptions</h4>
        <p>When speculatively executing instructions (e.g., beyond a predicted branch):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Exceptions on speculative instructions are recorded but not immediately taken</li>
          <li>If speculation is correct, the exception is handled normally at retirement</li>
          <li>If speculation is incorrect, the exception is simply discarded with the instruction</li>
        </ul>
        
        <pre style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
# Consider this code sequence
beq  x1, x2, skip    # Branch might be predicted incorrectly
lw   x3, 0(x0)       # Invalid address, would cause exception
add  x4, x3, x5      # Uses result of faulting load
skip:
addi x6, x6, 1       # Execution continues here if branch taken

# If branch is predicted not taken but actually is taken:
# - Load and add are executed speculatively
# - Load causes exception, but it's not processed immediately
# - If branch resolves as taken, load and add are discarded along with exception
# - Execution continues at "skip" label</pre>
        
        <p>This approach ensures that speculative instructions don't cause unnecessary exceptions that would disrupt execution.</p>

# Register values before execution: x1 = 100, x2 = 200, x3 = 300, x4 = unknown

1. lw  x5, 0(x1)     # Load from memory address 100, assume cache miss (100 cycle latency)
2. add x6, x2, x3    # x6 = 200 + 300 = 500, independent of 1
3. sub x7, x5, x2    # x7 = x5 - 200, depends on 1 (RAW on x5)
4. mul x8, x6, x3    # x8 = x6 * 300 = 150000, depends on 2 (RAW on x6)
5. div x9, x7, x6    # x9 = x7 / x6, depends on 3 and 4 (RAW on x7 and x6)

# Analysis:
# 1. The out-of-order processor executes independent instructions during the cache miss
# 2. Instructions 2, 4, and 6 complete much earlier than in the in-order case
# 3. The total execution time is slightly lower (112 vs 117 cycles)
# 4. With more independent instructions, the benefit would be even greater
# 5. Instructions commit in original program order despite executing out of order
# 6. Register renaming would be used to track dependencies correctly`,
      explanation: "This example demonstrates how an out-of-order processor executes instructions based on data availability rather than program order. When the load instruction causes a cache miss, the in-order processor stalls completely until the data is available. In contrast, the out-of-order processor continues executing independent instructions (those not dependent on the load result) during the cache miss, improving overall throughput. Despite executing instructions out of order, the processor ensures that architectural state is updated in program order through mechanisms like the reorder buffer. This example illustrates the fundamental benefit of out-of-order execution: hiding latency by finding and executing independent instructions."

      description: "Implementation details of register renaming in an out-of-order processor",
      code: `// Example register renaming system with register alias table (RAT)
// Architectural registers: x0-x31 (RISC-V)
// Physical registers: p0-p63 (64 physical registers)

// Register Alias Table: maps architectural registers to physical registers
// Free List: tracks available physical registers
// Reorder Buffer: tracks in-flight instructions

// Initial state:
// - Architectural registers x0-x31 mapped to physical registers p0-p31
// - Physical registers p32-p63 on free list
// - x0 is hardwired to zero (p0 always contains 0)

// Assembly code sequence:
//   add x1, x2, x3   # x1 = x2 + x3
//   sub x4, x1, x5   # x4 = x1 - x5
//   mul x1, x6, x7   # x1 = x6 * x7
//   add x8, x1, x4   # x8 = x1 + x4

// Renaming process:

// Instruction 1: add x1, x2, x3
// - Rename destination: x1 -> allocate p32 from free list
// - Rename sources: x2 -> p2, x3 -> p3 (from RAT)
// - Update RAT: x1 maps to p32
// - Renamed instruction: add p32, p2, p3
// - ROB entry 1: Writing p32 (for x1), old mapping was p1

// Instruction 2: sub x4, x1, x5
// - Rename destination: x4 -> allocate p33 from free list
// - Rename sources: x1 -> p32 (from RAT), x5 -> p5 (from RAT)
// - Update RAT: x4 maps to p33
// - Renamed instruction: sub p33, p32, p5
// - ROB entry 2: Writing p33 (for x4), old mapping was p4

// Instruction 3: mul x1, x6, x7
// - Rename destination: x1 -> allocate p34 from free list
// - Rename sources: x6 -> p6, x7 -> p7 (from RAT)
// - Update RAT: x1 maps to p34 (overwriting previous mapping to p32)
// - Renamed instruction: mul p34, p6, p7
// - ROB entry 3: Writing p34 (for x1), old mapping was p32

// Instruction 4: add x8, x1, x4
// - Rename destination: x8 -> allocate p35 from free list
// - Rename sources: x1 -> p34 (from RAT), x4 -> p33 (from RAT)
// - Update RAT: x8 maps to p35
// - Renamed instruction: add p35, p34, p33
// - ROB entry 4: Writing p35 (for x8), old mapping was p8

// After renaming, RAT state:
// x0 -> p0 (zero)   x8 -> p35 (new)   x16 -> p16   x24 -> p24
// x1 -> p34 (new)   x9 -> p9          x17 -> p17   x25 -> p25
// x2 -> p2          x10 -> p10        x18 -> p18   x26 -> p26
// x3 -> p3          x11 -> p11        x19 -> p19   x27 -> p27
// x4 -> p33 (new)   x12 -> p12        x20 -> p20   x28 -> p28
// x5 -> p5          x13 -> p13        x21 -> p21   x29 -> p29
// x6 -> p6          x14 -> p14        x22 -> p22   x30 -> p30
// x7 -> p7          x15 -> p15        x23 -> p23   x31 -> p31

// Free list: p36-p63 (p32-p35 have been allocated)

// When instructions commit, in program order:
// - ROB entry 1 commits: p1 can be added to free list
// - ROB entry 2 commits: p4 can be added to free list
// - ROB entry 3 commits: p32 can be added to free list
// - ROB entry 4 commits: p8 can be added to free list

// Key observations:
// 1. WAW hazard between instructions 1 and 3 is eliminated (they write to different physical registers)
// 2. Instruction 4 correctly gets the value from instruction 3 for x1, not instruction 1
// 3. Physical registers are freed only after the instruction that overwrites them commits
// 4. Register x0 is never renamed as it always contains zero`,
      explanation: "This example shows the detailed operation of register renaming in an out-of-order processor. The processor maintains a Register Alias Table (RAT) that maps architectural registers (visible to the programmer) to physical registers (actual hardware locations). Each time an instruction writes to an architectural register, a new physical register is allocated from the free list. This eliminates WAR and WAW hazards by ensuring that each register write has its own unique destination. The example demonstrates how the RAT is updated for each instruction and how dependencies are tracked using physical register numbers. When instructions commit, physical registers that are no longer needed are returned to the free list. This mechanism is essential for enabling out-of-order execution while maintaining correct program behavior."

      {
        question: "What is the primary advantage of a superscalar processor over a scalar pipelined processor?",
        options: [
          "It can execute instructions from multiple threads simultaneously",
          "It can fetch, decode, and execute multiple instructions per cycle",
          "It eliminates the need for branch prediction",
          "It uses a higher clock frequency"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "The primary advantage of a superscalar processor is that it can fetch, decode, and execute multiple instructions per cycle. While a scalar pipelined processor overlaps the execution of multiple instructions, it still only issues one instruction per cycle. Superscalar processors have multiple execution units that can operate in parallel, significantly increasing throughput."

      {
        question: "What problem does out-of-order execution primarily solve?",
        options: [
          "Branch mispredictions",
          "Memory access latency",
          "Limited register count",
          "Power consumption"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "Out-of-order execution primarily addresses memory access latency by allowing independent instructions to execute while waiting for long-latency operations (like cache misses) to complete. Instead of stalling the entire pipeline when one instruction is waiting for data, the processor can continue executing other instructions that don't depend on the pending result."
      },
      {
        question: "Which types of hazards does register renaming eliminate?",
        options: [
          "RAW hazards only",
          "WAR hazards only",
          "WAW hazards only",
          "Both WAR and WAW hazards"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 3,
        explanation: "Register renaming eliminates both WAR (Write-After-Read) and WAW (Write-After-Write) hazards by mapping architectural registers to a larger set of physical registers. Each write operation gets a new physical register, ensuring that writes to the same architectural register don't interfere with each other and that readers can access the correct version of a register."

        question: "What is a reorder buffer (ROB) used for in an out-of-order processor?",
        options: [
          "Storing branch prediction information",

          "Holding instructions waiting for execution"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "A reorder buffer (ROB) is used to track all in-flight instructions in program order and ensure they commit (update the architectural state) in program order, even though they may execute out of order. The ROB enables precise exception handling and proper speculative execution recovery by maintaining the status of each instruction's execution."

      {
        question: "What is meant by a 'precise exception' in the context of advanced pipelines?",
        options: [
          "An exception that is detected with high accuracy",
          "An exception where the processor state reflects sequential execution up to the faulting instruction",
          "An exception that can be handled without operating system intervention",
          "An exception that occurs at a predictable point in the program"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "A precise exception means the processor state is exactly as if the program executed sequentially up to the faulting instruction. Instructions before the faulting instruction have completed, instructions after it have not affected processor state, and the program counter points to the faulting instruction. This allows for reliable exception handling and program resumption."

        explanation: "Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) refers to the potential overlap among instructions that can be exploited for parallel execution. It represents how many instructions can be executed simultaneously without dependencies between them. The performance of superscalar processors depends heavily on the amount of ILP available in the code."

        options: [
          "The exception is immediately handled by the exception handler",
          "The exception is recorded but not taken until the instruction is committed",
          "The processor stalls until the speculation is resolved",
          "The exception is always ignored regardless of whether the speculation was correct"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "When a speculative instruction causes an exception in an out-of-order processor, the exception is recorded but not immediately taken. If the speculation turns out to be correct, the exception will be handled when the instruction commits (reaches the head of the reorder buffer). If the speculation was incorrect, the instruction and its exception are simply discarded when the pipeline is flushed."

          "The clock frequency"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "The key limitation that determines how many instructions a superscalar processor can effectively execute per cycle is the amount of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) available in the code. Even with many execution units, if instructions have dependencies between them (data or control), they cannot execute in parallel. Real programs typically have limited ILP, which is why actual throughput is often lower than the processor's theoretical maximum."

          "As soon as the instruction that writes to it completes execution",
          "When the next instruction that writes to the same architectural register executes",
          "When the instruction that overwrites its corresponding architectural register commits",
          "At the end of the current program's execution"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "In register renaming, a physical register is freed and returned to the free list when the instruction that overwrites its corresponding architectural register commits (not just executes). This ensures that if a pipeline flush occurs (due to branch misprediction or exception), the processor can recover the correct register mappings. Freeing registers too early could lead to incorrect execution if speculation fails."

        explanation: "Tomasulo's algorithm is primarily known as a dynamic scheduling approach that enables out-of-order execution. Developed by Robert Tomasulo at IBM in the 1960s, it uses reservation stations, register renaming, and a common data bus to track operand availability and allow instructions to execute as soon as their operands are ready, regardless of program order. It forms the conceptual foundation for most modern out-of-order execution implementations."
