      explanation: "This example presents a conceptual design for a RISC-V-based edge AI processor targeting smart devices, industrial control, and IoT applications. The architecture illustrates several emerging trends in RISC-V processor design: heterogeneous multi-core configurations, specialized accelerators, and system-on-chip integration. The design features both general-purpose RISC-V cores (RV64GC application processors) and a smaller control core (RV32EC) for system management. These are complemented by domain-specific accelerators for AI workloads, signal processing, and security functions. The design showcases how RISC-V's extensibility enables the creation of specialized computing platforms that balance general-purpose programmability with domain-specific acceleration. Such architectures are particularly valuable for edge AI applications that require local processing of sensor data with stringent power constraints. This represents a growing trend in RISC-V adoption, where the base ISA provides the foundation for integrating custom extensions and accelerators in a coherent system architecture."

      explanation: "This example explores emerging security extensions for RISC-V processors, focusing on technologies that enable trusted execution environments (TEEs) and secure enclaves. The code demonstrates both existing security features like Physical Memory Protection (PMP) and conceptual extensions that are under development or consideration by the RISC-V security community. The example includes implementations of secure mode transitions, hardware-based attestation, integrity measurement, and hardware random number generation. It also outlines a secure boot implementation and a simple secure enclave API. While some of these extensions are still evolving and not yet standardized, they represent important directions in RISC-V security research and development. As security becomes increasingly critical for edge devices, IoT, and cloud computing, these types of extensions will be essential for RISC-V to compete in security-sensitive markets. The open nature of RISC-V allows security researchers and industry experts to collaboratively develop and standardize these extensions, potentially leading to more transparent and thoroughly vetted security mechanisms compared to proprietary architectures."

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "RISC-V's approach to physical memory protection (PMP) enhances security in embedded systems by allowing fine-grained control over memory access permissions for different privilege levels. PMP allows system designers to precisely define which memory regions can be accessed by code running at different privilege levels, with what permissions (read, write, execute). This mechanism can prevent unprivileged code from accessing sensitive memory regions, helping to contain security breaches and enforce isolation between different components of a system."

This trend acknowledges that different workloads have different computational characteristics, and a combination of general-purpose processors with specialized accelerators can provide better performance and energy efficiency than either approach alone. RISC-V serves as the general-purpose control and processing foundation, while custom accelerators handle specialized tasks like AI inference, signal processing, or cryptography."
