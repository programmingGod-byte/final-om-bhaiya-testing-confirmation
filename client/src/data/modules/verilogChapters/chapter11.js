          <h4>AXI Handshaking</h4>
          <p>AXI uses a valid/ready handshaking mechanism for flow control:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The source asserts <strong>valid</strong> when data or address is available</li>
            <li>The destination asserts <strong>ready</strong> when it can accept data or address</li>
            <li>Transfer occurs when both <strong>valid</strong> and <strong>ready</strong> are asserted</li>
            <li>Valid cannot be deasserted until transfer completes</li>
            <li>Ready can be asserted before, with, or after valid</li>

        id: "q11_1",
        question: "Which of the following is NOT a typical component in a System-on-Chip?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "CPU core" },
          { id: "b", text: "Memory controller" },
          { id: "c", text: "Printed circuit board" },
          { id: "d", text: "Peripheral interfaces" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: "A printed circuit board (PCB) is not a component within a System-on-Chip; rather, it's the substrate on which an SoC and other components are mounted. Typical SoC components include CPU cores, memory controllers, peripherals, bus interconnects, accelerators, and interface controllers—all integrated on a single silicon die."
      },
      {
        id: "q11_2",
        question: "What is the primary purpose of a bus interconnect architecture in an SoC?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "To connect the SoC to external memory" },
          { id: "b", text: "To provide a standardized communication infrastructure between IP blocks" },
          { id: "c", text: "To implement clock domain crossing" },
          { id: "d", text: "To reduce power consumption" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: "The primary purpose of a bus interconnect architecture is to provide a standardized communication infrastructure between different IP blocks within an SoC. It handles transaction routing, arbitration, protocol conversion, and address decoding, allowing IP blocks to communicate without needing to know the details of each other's interfaces."
      },
      {
        id: "q11_3",
        question: "What is an advantage of using the AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) protocol in SoC designs?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "It only requires a single clock domain for the entire SoC" },
          { id: "b", text: "It supports independent address/data channels and out-of-order transaction completion" },
          { id: "c", text: "It is the simplest bus protocol to implement" },
          { id: "d", text: "It eliminates the need for bus arbitration" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: "AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) provides several advantages for SoC designs, including separate address and data channels, out-of-order transaction completion, burst transfers, and multiple outstanding transactions. These features enable higher performance through parallelism and flexibility, making it well-suited for complex SoC designs with varying bandwidth requirements."
      },
      {
        id: "q11_4",
        question: "What is a Network-on-Chip (NoC)?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "An SoC with integrated networking capabilities" },
          { id: "b", text: "A communication subsystem that routes packets between IP blocks on an SoC" },
          { id: "c", text: "A protocol for connecting multiple SoCs together" },
          { id: "d", text: "A software stack for managing SoC communication" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: "A Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a communication subsystem that routes packets between intellectual property (IP) blocks on an SoC. Unlike traditional bus architectures, NoCs use network principles (routers, switches, packets) for on-chip communication, offering better scalability, throughput, and parallelism for complex SoCs with many components."
      },
      {
        id: "q11_5",
        question: "What is clock domain crossing (CDC) in SoC design?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "The process of distributing a single clock throughout the entire chip" },
          { id: "b", text: "A technique for generating multiple clock frequencies from a single source" },
          { id: "c", text: "The transfer of signals between regions operating on different clock domains" },
          { id: "d", text: "The ability to dynamically change clock frequencies for power savings" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: "Clock domain crossing (CDC) refers to the transfer of signals between regions of an SoC that operate on different clock domains (different frequencies or phases). This requires special synchronization circuits to prevent metastability and data corruption. Proper CDC handling is critical in modern SoCs, which typically contain multiple independent clock domains."
      },
      {
        id: "q11_6",
        question: "Which approach to SoC verification provides the most comprehensive system-level validation?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "RTL simulation of individual blocks" },
          { id: "b", text: "Hardware-software co-verification using emulation or FPGA prototyping" },
          { id: "c", text: "Static timing analysis" },
          { id: "d", text: "Formal verification of interface protocols" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: "Hardware-software co-verification using emulation or FPGA prototyping provides the most comprehensive system-level validation for SoCs. It allows the actual software that will run on the SoC to be tested with a realistic hardware model, uncovering integration issues, performance bottlenecks, and system-level bugs that might not be visible when verifying individual components separately."
      },
      {
        id: "q11_7",
        question: "What is the benefit of using standardized IP interfaces in SoC design?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "They eliminate the need for interface documentation" },
          { id: "b", text: "They guarantee that all IP will be compatible regardless of vendor" },
          { id: "c", text: "They simplify integration and enable IP reuse across different designs" },
          { id: "d", text: "They ensure all IP blocks will have the same performance characteristics" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: "Standardized IP interfaces simplify integration and enable IP reuse across different designs. When IP blocks adhere to standard interfaces like AXI, APB, or OCP, designers can mix and match components from different sources with minimal adaptation, accelerating development and reducing integration risks. This 'plug-and-play' approach is essential for complex SoCs with dozens of IP blocks."
      },
      {
        id: "q11_8",
        question: "What is a common challenge when integrating third-party IP into an SoC?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "Interface adaptation and protocol conversion" },
          { id: "b", text: "Third-party IP is always delivered without documentation" },
          { id: "c", text: "Third-party IP cannot be simulated before silicon fabrication" },
          { id: "d", text: "Third-party IP always requires custom on-chip memories" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: "Interface adaptation and protocol conversion are common challenges when integrating third-party IP. Even with standardized interfaces, differences in parameters, clock requirements, reset behavior, or protocol versions often require adapter logic or 'glue logic' to be developed. Other challenges include documentation quality, verification strategies, and ensuring the IP meets performance requirements."
